\033[1;37m# Educational Security Simulation\033[0m

\033[1;33m⚠️  WARNING: This is a SIMULATION for demonstration purposes only! ⚠️\033[0m

${PURPLE}This demonstration simulates a web application attack by injecting a \
fake cryptominer and making it persistent. The attack exploits a command \
injection vulnerability in the target web application, allowing us to execute \
arbitrary commands on the server. We will download a simulated cryptocurrency \
mining malware (harmless demo binary), configure it for persistence, and \
execute it with high CPU priority to demonstrate the attack methodology. \
This is purely for educational and security awareness purposes.\033[0m

\033[1;33mThe malware used in this simulation is FAKE and HARMLESS.\033[0m

\033[1;35mInitial Payload Delivery - Download Simulated Malware Binary\033[0m

${PURPLE}In this first step, we exploit the command injection vulnerability to \
download a simulated cryptocurrency mining malware from a remote repository. \
We use curl with the -OL flags to follow redirects and save the file with its \
original name. The simulated malware binary will be downloaded to the web \
server's document root directory, making it accessible and ready for \
execution. Note: This is a harmless demonstration binary.\033[0m

step <<EOF
${PURPLE}Privilege Escalation - Set Execution Permissions\033[0m

${PURPLE}Now we need to make the downloaded simulated malware binary executable \
by setting the appropriate file permissions. We use the chmod command with \
the +x flag to add execute permissions for the owner, group, and others. \
This step is crucial because without execution permissions, the simulated \
malware binary cannot be executed, even if we attempt to run it directly. \
This demonstrates how real attackers would prepare their payloads.\033[0m

step <<EOF
${PURPLE}Persistence Mechanism - Establish Startup Persistence\033[0m

${PURPLE}To demonstrate how malware survives system reboots and maintains \
persistence, we add the simulated malware path to the system's startup \
configuration file (/etc/rc.common). This file is executed during system \
initialization, ensuring that our simulated malware would automatically \
start every time the system boots up. We use bash -c to properly handle \
the redirection operator and append the malware path to the startup file. \
This shows the persistence techniques used by real attackers.\033[0m

step <<EOF
${PURPLE}Simulated Malware Execution - Launch Demo Mining Operation\033[0m

${PURPLE}In the final step, we execute the simulated malware binary with high \
CPU priority (44) to demonstrate how real malware would maximize mining \
performance. The --cpu-priority flag ensures that the simulated mining \
process receives significant CPU resources, allowing it to compete \
effectively for computational power. This step demonstrates the actual \
cryptocurrency mining operation methodology, but uses a harmless demo \
binary that simulates the behavior without causing real damage.\033[0m
